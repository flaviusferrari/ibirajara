                        <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, well chilled (i try to cook them to just past soft boiled stage, then stick them in the coldest part of the fridge to firm up)</li>
                        <li>1 pound good quality sausage meat (i used ground turkey meat, seasoned with sage, white pepper, salt and a tiny bit of maple syrup)</li>

                        <li>1-2 eggs, beaten</li>

                        <blockquote>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of 
                            wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the 
                            epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness,
                            it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything 
                            before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we 
                            were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the
                            present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being 
                            received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
